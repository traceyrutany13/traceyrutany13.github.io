It spans all types of Ma and restructuring transactions and covers all the relevant knowledge from the academic research to the practical legal accounting and regulatory details. The book is up-to-date and teaches the state of the art techniques used today. The book contains numerous cases and spreadsheet support that enables the reader to put into practice everything that is covered. The combination of great writing and active case learning makes this book the best I have seen in the Ma and restructuring arena.?<br>--Matthew T. Billett Associate Professor of Finance Henry B Tippie Research Fellow University of Iowa<br> br>“I am happy to recommend the 5th edition of Mergers Acquisitions and Other Restructuring Activities. Having used prior editions of Don DePamphilis’ text I can affirm that the newest edition builds on a firm foundation of coverage real-world examples and readability. My students have consistently responded favorably to prior editions of the book. In the newest edition I was delighted to discover that Don is expanding his coverage of family-owned businesses already a strength in his earlier editions that were distinguished by their coverage of the valuation of privately-held businesses. Additional attention is paid to restructuring bankruptcy and liquidation as well as risk management which are clearly topics of interest to every business person in today’s economic climate.? <br>--Kent Hickman Professor of Finance Gonzaga University WA<br>“This new edition is one of the most comprehensive books on mergers and acquisitions. The text combines theories valuation models and real-life cases to give business students an overall insight into the Ma deal process. The up-to-date real-life examples and cases provide opportunities for readers to explore and to apply theories to a wide variety of scenarios such as cross-border transactions highly-levered deals firms in financial distress and family-own businesses . The chapter on restructuring under bankruptcy and liquidation both inside and outside the protection of bankruptcy court is timely and most useful in light of today’s economic crisis. Overall this is an excellent book on mergers acquisitions and corporate restructuring activities.?<br>--Tao-Hsien Dolly King Rush S. Dickson Professor of Finance Associate Professor Department of Finance The Belk College of Business University of North Carolina at Charlotte <br>“Mergers Acquisitions and Other Restructuring Activities is an interesting and comprehensive look at the most important aspects of Ma and corporate restructuring --- from strategic and regulatory considerations and Ma deal process through several chapters on Ma valuation and deal structuring to other types of restructuring activities. It not only provides a road map for the Ma and other corporate restructuring transactions but also highlights the key things to watch for. The book is clearly written with extensive but easy-to-follow case examples and empirical findings and cases to illustrate the points in the text. It is a book by an expert and for Ma instructors and students as well as practitioners.?<br>--Qiao Lui Faculty of Business and Economics The University of Hong Kong<br>“I am delighted with Don DePamphilis"s new edition of the Merger Acquisitions and Other Restructuring Activities Fifth Edition text. It is a clear comprehensive and thorough discussion of the issues involving all restructuring activities. The use of mini-cases throughout each chapter both highlights and clarifies key elements of aspects of decision making process. The end-of-chapter discussion questions are ideally complimented with the problem set questions to challenge the reader understanding of the covered concepts. I am impressed with the current reflection of market conditions throughout the text and the extent of the recent changes to provide greater understanding for students. I expect to find that the students are also impressed with the clarity and structure of the text when I introduce the newest edition to my course. I recommend the fifth edition to any professor covering mergers acquisitions bankruptcies or other restructuring topics which may be used for specific chapters to cover limited topics or as a text for a complete course on restructurings.?<br>--John F Manley Ph.D Professor of Finance Hagan School of Business Iona College NY<br>“Mergers and Acquisitions continue to be amongst the preferred competitive options available to the companies seeking to grow and prosper in the rapidly changing global business. scenario.<br>In this new updated and revised Fifth Edition of his path breaking book - the author and Ma expert Dr. DePamphilis illustrates how mergers acquisitions and other major forms of restructuring can help a company grow and prosper in the highly complex and competitive corporate takeover market place. <br>Interspersed with the most relevant and up-to-date Ma case studies covering a broad range of industries this book deals with the multifarious aspects of corporate restructuring in an integrated manner adopting a lucid style. While academic research studies on the subject have been incorporated in a coherent manner at appropriate places in the book every effort has been made by the author to deal with the intricacies of the subject by offering comprehensive coverage of the latest methods and techniques adopted in managing Ma transactions in general and in dealing with business valuations of both public and private companies in particular.<br>The book provides practical ways of dealing with Mas even in an economic downturn with an exclusive chapter on corporate restructuring under bankruptcy and liquidation. With the greatly enlarged and up-to-date material on varied aspects of the subject the book provides a plethora of real world examples which will go a long way in making the subject easy stimulating and interesting to both the academicians and practitioners alike .?<br>--Donepudi Prasad ICFAI Business School Hyderabad India<br>“Professor DePamphilis has made significant important and very timely updates in this 5th edition of his text. He incorporates contemporary events such as the credit crunch and the latest accounting rules in the West plus Ma issues in emerging markets which includes family businesses. He also reads corporate governance a topic that will become increasingly important in Business Schools the world over in Ma This text has become and will increasingly become the definitive comprehensive and thorough text reference on the subject.?<br>-- Jeffrey V Ramsbottom PhD Visiting Professor China Europe International Business School Shanghai<br>“I think the fifth edition of Mergers Acquisitions and Other Restructuring Activities does a comprehensive job of covering the Ma field. As in the previous edition the structure is divided into five parts. These are logical and easy to follow with a nice blend of theory empirical research findings and practical issues. I especially like two chapters ? the chapter on bankruptcy and liquidation is extremely relevant in today’s economic conditions and the chapter on private equity and hedge funds is interesting because Ma activities by these players are not well-documented in the literature. Overall I believe that MBA students would find the book useful both as a textbook in class and as a reference book for later use.?<br>--Raghavendra Rau Purdue University IN and Barclays Global Investors<br>“This book is truly outstanding among the textbooks on takeovers valuation and corporate restructuring for several reasons: the DePamphilis book not only gives a very up-to-date overview of the recent research findings on takeovers around the world but also offers nearly 100 recent businesses cases. The book treats all the valuation techniques in depth and also offers much institutional detail on Ma and LBO transactions. Not just takeover successes are analyzed but also how financially distressed companies should be restructured. In short the ideal textbook for any Ma graduate course.?<br>-- Luc Renneboog Professor of Corporate Finance Tilburg University The Netherlands<br>“The 5th Edition of the text-book Mergers Acquisitions and Other Restructuring Activities by Professor Donald DePamphilis is an excellent book. Among its many strengths I could easily identify three features that stand out. First it is up-to-date covering the recent knowledge published in most of the academic journals. Second it offers a comprehensive coverage of the subject matter including chapters on the U.S.<br><br>【発送方法】<br>こちらの商品はご注文後に海外からお取り寄せいたしますので、お届けまでに2週間から4週間程度のお時間をいただいております。最大で1か月ほどかかる場合がございますので、お急ぎの方はご購入をお控えいただけますようお願いいたします。ご注文後、弊社の国内配送センターへ取り寄せ、検品・再梱包を行い、「レターパック」または「クリックポスト」にてお客様へ発送いたします。<br><br>【キャンセル商品】<br>ご注文後はリアルタイムで海外へ発注が行われますため、原則としてキャンセルはお受けできません。ご注文の際には十分にご確認の上、お手続きください<br/><br/><img src="https://item-shopping.c.yimg.jp/i/n/magicdoor_9780123748782_i_20240708182920" />
