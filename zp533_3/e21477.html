Babel"s celebrated stature--which had already been achieved during his lifetime--the whole of his work owing to his arrest and the state of affairs in the Soviet Union was never assembled in one place.<br> This magnificent edition of Babel"s collected work fulfills a lifelong ambition of Babel"s daughter Nathalie who has authorized and edited the entire collection and has collaborated with award-winning translator Peter Constantine in preparing the work for publication. Every story or selection included in this volume (147 in total) has been newly edited and translated beginning with Babel"s first published story "Old Shloyme" originally published in 1913 and concluding with two scenes from a screenplay that Babel did not live. to see made into a film. Included in <br>The Complete Works<br> are stories that will be familiar to Babel enthusiasts like the "Red Cavalry" cycle and his diaries as well as untranslated stories and other works that appear in English for the first time.&lt; br&gt; To read Babel is to relive the wild and often terrifying swings of twenty-century Russian history. No writer has conveyed with such emotion and convulsive energy the tragic story of a modern nation that remained a prisoner of its brutal and repressive past. Combining the compassion of Dostoevsky with the mordant wit of Chekhov Babel injected a daring social criticism and a palpable sexual tension into the literary climate of post-tsarist Russia. In the process he created a style so vivid so lacerating and so utterly hypnotic that his stories have come to define the sanguinary landscape of the Soviet Union in the years between the two world wars.<br> As these stories illustrate and As Cynthia Ozick insightfully observes in her passionate introduction Babel was a man of acute contradictions. Born in the cosmopolitan port city of Odessa during the long reign of Alexander II Babel was quite competent in both Hebrew and Yiddish but influenced by both Flaubert and Maupassant wrote his first stories in fluent French. His often comic portrayal of characters--such as the ruthless Jewish mobsters depicted in his Benya Krik stories--resulted from observing them firsthand as a boy in the Moldavanka neighborhood of Odessa. As Ozick notes the "breadth and scope of his social compass enabled him to see through the eyes of peasants soldiers priests rabbis children artists actors women of all classes. . . . He was at once a poet of the city ("the glass sun of Petersburg") and a lyricist of the countryside ("the walls of sunset collapsing into the sky")."<br> Arranged sequentially in fourteen sections <br>The Complete Works<br> traces the entire arc of Babel"s literary career beginning with early stories which are followed by The Odessa Stories and The Red Cavalry Stories. Also included are his Reports from St. Petersburg (1918) the remarkable 1920 Diary and reports from Soviet Georgia and France where his wife Evgenia and his daughter Nathalie lived. Many of his later stories (1925-38) reflect a compelling literary quality and abrupt change in style that have challenged translators for years. An accomplished playwright and screenwriter Babel at the height of his popularity began writing for the Soviet cinema as early as the 1920s and many of these works have never been translated before. This edition also includes a foreword and a biographical afterword by Nathalie Babel a translator"s preface and annotations throughout by Peter Constantine and a chronology by Gregory Freidin regarded as one of the foremost Babel scholars in the world.<br> Unprecedented for both its literary and its scholarly achievement <br>The Complete Works of Isaac Babel<br> will stand as Babel"s final most enduring legacy.<br><br><br>【発送方法】<br>こちらの商品はご注文後に海外からお取り寄せいたしますので、お届けまでに2週間から4週間程度のお時間をいただいております。最大で1か月ほどかかる場合がございますので、お急ぎの方はご購入をお控えいただけますようお願いいたします。ご注文後、弊社の国内配送センターへ取り寄せ、検品・再梱包を行い、「レターパック」または「クリックポスト」にてお客様へ発送いたします。<br><br>【キャンセル商品】<br>ご注文後はリアルタイムで海外へ発注が行われますため、原則としてキャンセルはお受けできません。ご注文の際には十分にご確認の上、お手続きくださいますようお願い申し上げます。<br><br>【在庫切れ・遅延の場合】<br>1か月以上の遅延やメーカーの在庫切れなどが発生した場合には、必ずメールにてご連絡の上、当店からキャンセルさせていただきます。ご注文から1か月を超えても当店からの連絡がないまま放置されることはございませんので、ご安心ください。<br><br>【発送準備中】<br>メーカーから商品を手配中の際は【発送準備中】と表示されます。問題なく商品の手配・発送準備が進んでおりますので、どうぞご安心ください。最大で1か月まで【発送準備中】と表示される場合がございます。<br/><br/><img src="https://item-shopping.c.yimg.jp/i/n/magicdoor_9780393048469_i_20240709044749" />
